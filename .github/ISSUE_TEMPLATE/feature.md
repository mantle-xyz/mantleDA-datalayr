**User story**
User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows: 'As a PERSONA, I want to GOAL_DESCRIPTION, so that CUSTOMER_VALUE_DESCRIPTION.' 

**Actions**
- [ ] An action item list describing the work to be done
- [ ] Include everything in the definition of done 
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Documentation

**Acceptance criteria**
Acceptance criteria are the requirements that need to be met in order to mark a user story as complete. For example, if your user story is, "As a New Relic customer I want to know how to interpret AI anomalies in order to monitor my site and protect myself against incidents," then the acceptance criteria would be: "A complete and published doc describing AI anomalies." We'll use the acceptance criteria to test that the issue is completed.
